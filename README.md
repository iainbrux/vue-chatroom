### ‚ú® About the project

This project was my first big project using Vue.js. I have been following through NetNinja's Vue course who has helped me develop myself so much further in my quest to become a full-stack developer. All credit to Shaun who can be found here https://netninja.dev/

The project was to create a live-chat application that utilises Vue 3 in partnership with Firebase for BaaS. 

My project demonstrates an understanding of basic Vue 3 components, composables, routing and more. My project also demonstrates my ability to understand asynchronous JavaScript in a more complex manner, through the use of async & await as well as try/catch. This project also helps to demonstrate a beginner understanding of firebase-cli with authentication, GET/POST/PATCH and hosting.
